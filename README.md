# peg-thing

My take at clojure for the brave and true example.

It has a different organization (it uses several modules instead of putting everything to one) and it's not a copy/paste, there are minor modifications here and there as I was testing stuff.

## Installation

git clone http://github.com/willyfrog/peg-thing

## Usage

    $ lein run
